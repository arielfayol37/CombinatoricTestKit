# CombinatoricTestKit
is a Python-based tool designed to generate comprehensive test cases for combinatorial logic functions. This repository provides an efficient solution for testing all possible failure scenarios in logic circuits and ensuring thorough validation of logical operations.

# HOW TO USE IT
- You need to have Python Install on your computer https://www.python.org/downloads/ . I recommend version 11 or 10, NOT 12.
- When you are done downloading python, open the command line and navivate to this folder.
- Execute the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
- You are all set. Now go to combi_test.py and modify the test_function() method to your specification.
- When you are done writing your function, save and execute the command: python combi_test.py
